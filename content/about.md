I'm Karteek. I would love to call myself a technology enthusiast and a philomath (a seeker of knowledge and facts).
And, this is the place where I'm trying to document my journey of my learnings. As I'm a techie working
for a technology company, my learnings end up mostly being about technology. And much less about
exciting adventures.

I solve problems [professionally](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karteek) and for [fun](https://github.com/karteek).
I enjoy programming challenges from [ProjectEuler](https://projecteuler.net) and more recently from [HackerRank](http://hackerrank.com/).
I spend time reading about new things at [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and taking [pictures](https://www.instagram.com/karteek.e/) when I get to travel. You can find me at [@karteek](https://twitter.com/karteek) or mail me [at] my domain name.
