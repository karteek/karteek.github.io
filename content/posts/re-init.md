It has been a long time I wrote anything or tried something new here. My domain started to look like an abandoned city.
So, I'm re-initing it now with something much simpler combination of [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and Github [pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Hugo is a ridiculously fast static site generator, and Github pages is a very easy way of hosting those pages.

This static site will be replacing my `golang` based homepage that fetched and rendered articles from my tumblr based blog. As this site is going to be a simple set of static pages, there is no need of `heroku` now. Back to basics.

Simplicity.
